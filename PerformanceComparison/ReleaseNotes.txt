Version 2.0.0.2 (Released 1st November 2009)
============================================
1. Changed the application to seperate out Speed, Climb, and Turn data on to 
   seperate tabs.
2. Created a custom user control for a custom view of aircraft turn performance.
3. Changed the format of the XML data files. Added Instantaneous turn performance 
   data, stall speed, and corner velocities. Removed old metrics.
4. Changed the way colours are assigned to aircraft lines on graphs so that
   an selected aircraft does not suddenly change colour when selecting an 
   aircraft that comes before it in the list. Once an aircraft is shown, it
   keeps its colour untill it is de-selected.
5. Changed the ordering of colour assignments. 
6. Added the B-239 Brewster Buffalo (turn testing performed by me).
7. Added the I-16 Polikarpov (turn testing performed by me).
8. Added turn information for the F4u-1A Corsair (turn testing performed by me).
7. Added the P-47M Thunderbolt (turn testing performed by me).
9. Removed the Me-163 as no data exists for it and it's extremely hard to test 
   in practice...
10. Fixed the spelling mistake in the windows title.



Version 1.2.0.0
===============
1. Replaced Kweassa's turn raduis data with Mosq's turn data including 
   turn radius, rate, deg/sec, sustained speed. 
2. Added 3 new turn plots in the turn data section to reflect the three
   new data added (rate, deg/sec, sustained speed).
3. Changed the format of the XML data files to accomodate the new turn 
   data. All XML files updated with MOSQs data.
4. Fixed a bug with the CheckedListBox if you double-click a single checkbox
5. Fixed a bug in the climb graph where the line plot re-paints itself wrong
   when you float the cursor over it. This also fixes the double-ups you may 
   have seen in the legend when you minimize/maximize the app or open a window
   over it then bring it to the top again.
6. Started and added the releasenotes.txt file to the distribution.
